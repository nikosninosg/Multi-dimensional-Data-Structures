# Multi-dimensional-Data-Structures

**K-D trees, Quad Trees και 2D Range Trees: 2D kNN Queries Implementation.**

Data:
The train and test dataset are split based on time, and the public/private leaderboard in the test data are split randomly. There is no concept of a person in this dataset. All the row_id's are events, not people. 

Note: Some of the columns, such as time and accuracy, are intentionally left vague in their definitions. Please consider them as part of the challenge. 

File descriptions
train.csv, test.csv 
- row_id: id of the check-in event
- x y: coordinates
- accuracy: location accuracy 
- time: timestamp
- place_id: id of the business, this is the target you are predicting
